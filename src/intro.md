# Introduction

(Sonic)BOOM is a multi-stage pipelined, out-of-order, non-superscalar (?), speculative CPU design that implements RV32/64 GCV, along with support for the standard 3-privilege level model (M-, S-, and U-modes).
As of 2025-03-05, the authors are not sure BOOM fully and correctly implements the ratified 4-privilege level model (M-, H-, VS-, VU-modes).
